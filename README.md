# Solid_Rascal
Welcome to the development of my first Roguelike!

## Introduction
**Solid_Rascal** is my first attempt of developing a roguelike, heavily inspired in ROGUE (almost a clone), this game will have the basics features of a roguelike.

The main objective of this project besides my sincere tribute to ROGUE, is to learn how to develop Roguelikes, and i hope that by trying to replicate the first game that brings this genre to life, is a good way to do so.

the project will be entirely open source, i'll try my best to fill it with useful commentaries, so fell free to take this code and learn with it, maybe develop your own game, and i'll be glad to know if this was useful to someone.

## Planned Features
* ### Dungeon Generator 

    Explore the endless dungeons of the [lore under development] to find treasures and mighty enemies.
* ### Player progression 

    Heroes gain experience from battles, and grow stronger for harder encounters.
* ### Monsters (and maybe bosses)   
    
    What is a dungeon without monsters? diverses creatures for the player to encounter, slaughter and probably die to.
* ### Various Weapons and Items

    Who knows what you'll find on the dark corners of the dungeons? stay live longer with equipment find on the dungeons
